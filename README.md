Lab Steps

Preparation:

If you are using the Citrix remote lab, follow the login instructions located on the iLab tab in Course Home.

Locate the Visual Studio 2010 icon and launch the application.

Lab:

Part A: Password Program

Step 1: Requirements

Write a windows console application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) menu similar to the following (this program assumes you are uniquely logged in).

Welcome to the DeVry Bank Automated Teller Machine

Check balance Make withdrawal Make deposit View account information View statement View bank information Exit

The result of choosing #1 will be the following:Current balance is: $2439.45

The result of choosing #2 will be the following:How much would you like to withdraw? $200.50

The result of choosing #3 will be the following:How much would you like to deposit? $177.32

The result of choosing #4 will be the following:

Name: (Student’s first and last name goes here)

Account Number: 1234554321

The result of choosing #5 will be the following:01/01/11 – McDonald’s – $6.27

01/15/11 – Kwik Trip – $34.93

02/28/11 – Target – $124.21

The result of choosing #6 will be the following:Devry Bank, established 2011

(123) 456-7890

12345 1st St.

Someplace, NJ 12345

The result of choosing #7 will be the following:*Exit the program – terminate console application.

Step 2: Processing Logic

You will create a Menu Builder class (for menu applications), a Test Menu class (for Main), and a MenuBuilder.h for a total of three files as a demonstration of understanding, creating, and using classes.

Using the pseudocode below, write the code that will meet the requirements.

Create a Test Menu class

For main method and to call the Menu Driven class

Create a MenuBuilder Class

This will be where you create statements for the following:

1. Check balance

2. Make withdrawal

3. Make deposit

4. View account information

5. View statement

6. View bank information

7. Exit

Create a MenuBuilder.h

Include a header file in your program. 2. This will be where you utilize standardized Identifiers,preprocessor directives, classes, namespaces, and so forth.

Step 3: Create a New Project

Create a new project and name it LAB6. Write your code using the Processing Logic in Step 2. Make sure you save your program.

Step 4: Compile and Execute

a) Compile your program and eliminate all syntax errors.

b) Build your program and verify the results of the program. Make corrections to the program logic if necessary until the results of the program execution are what you expect.

Step 5: Print Screenshots and Program

Capture a screen print of your output. (Do a PRINT SCREEN and paste into an MS Word document.) Copy your code and paste it into the same MS Word document that contains the screen print of your output. Save the Word document as Lab06B_LastName_FirstInitial.
